# SimpleNFL
A .h that simplifies the usage of NightFoxLib.
Putting a sprite on the screen used to take 4 lines of code, it now only takes 1.
There are also new functions included, like easy touch detection and button presses.

# A WARNING THINGY
I was looking through the code and realised some of it is un-optomised. I'm currently fixing these issues, so please wait for them to be finished. Other than that the rest or the project is fine so you may use it

# Installation
Download simplenfl.h

Add it in your source directory (main.c or .cpp) and include the file
eg: #include "simplenfl.h"

Remeber that this is liscensed, so remember to give credit for free use!

# Documentation
